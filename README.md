# The Dataset :
The data was taken from Kaggle site : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud .

The Columns do not have physical significance directly visible since as per the source (Kaggle) , the data was compressed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in order to protect the privacy of the individuals while making a realistic secnario dataset availaible to public .
# Data Preprocessing and Visualisation :

### Correlations :

The columns do not seem to have correlations with each other , and seem to have great correlation with the Class and time variables , hence being a great indicator that simple models would be helpful here , and neural networks wont be needed hopefully .
### Relation between target variables and columns :
